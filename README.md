# Reinforcement Learning and Optimal Control

This repository consists of Studies in Reinforcement Learning and Optimal Control, focused on monography and research in the area.

[Some introduction to the area.]

## Examples and Libraries

In the `examples` folder, one can find some of the working code examples:

* `examples/gymnasium_mountain_car`: we work on a classic problem from [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/), the [Mountain Car](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/classic_control/mountain_car/) problem.

For the examples, we use the [python Gymnasium](https://pypi.org/project/gymnasium/) library, along with some basic numeric and scientific libraries. One is advised to install the dependencies and run our examples in a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).
